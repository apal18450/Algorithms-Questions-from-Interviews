An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight
limit for a given boat is k, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights [100, 200, 150, 80] and a boat limit of 200, the smallest number of boats required will be three.

Program:
def min_boats(weights, k):
    weights.sort()
    i, j = 0, len(weights) - 1
    boats = 0
    
    while i <= j:
        if weights[i] + weights[j] <= k:
            i += 1  
            j -= 1  
        else:
            j -= 1
        boats += 1
    
    print("Boats required:", boats)

n = int(input("Enter the number of people: "))
weights = list(map(int, input("Enter the weights of the people: ").split()))
k = int(input("Enter the weight limit of the boat: "))
print(min_boats(weights, k))

Output:
Enter the number of people: 3
Enter the weights of the people: 100 150 200
Enter the weight limit of the boat: 300
Boats required: 2
