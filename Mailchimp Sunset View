You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.
For example, given the array [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], you should return 3, since the top floors of the buildings with heights 8, 6, and 1 all have an unobstructed view to the west.
Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?

Python Program: 

def buildings_with_sunset_view(buildings):
    if not buildings:
        return 0

    max_height = -1
    count = 0

    for height in buildings:
        if height > max_height:
            count += 1
            max_height = height

    return count

buildings = [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1]
print(buildings_with_sunset_view(buildings))
