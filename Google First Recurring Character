This problem was asked by Google.
Given a string, return the first recurring character in it, or null if there is no recurring character.
For example, given the string "acbbac", return "b". Given the string "abcdef", return null.

Program:

def first_recurring_character(s: str):
    seen = set()  
    for char in s:
        if char in seen:
            return char
        seen.add(char)
    return None

string = input("Enter a string: ")
result = first_recurring_character(string)

if result:
    print(f"The first recurring character in input string is: {result}")
else:
    print("There is no recurring character in the given string.")

Output: 
Enter a string: google
The first recurring character in input string is: o

Enter a string: computer
There is no recurring character in the given string.
