This problem was asked by Nvidia.

Find the maximum of two numbers without using any if-else statements, branching, or direct comparisons.

Program:
def maximum(a, b):
    return (a + b + abs(a - b)) // 2

def main():
    a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    result = maximum(a, b)
    print(f"The maximum of {a} and {b} is: {result}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
